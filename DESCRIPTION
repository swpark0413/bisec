Description: This package implements Bayesian inference for estimating spiked eigenstructures of high-dimensional covariance matrices.  By applying an inverse-Wishart prior to the covariance matrix, the package provides posterior distributions for eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Additionally, it offers a method for Bayesian principal component regression (PCR). This approach accounts for uncertainties in principal scores, thereby improving the interval estimation of regression coefficients in high-dimensional settings.
